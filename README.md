# 🦷 smile Specialty Dental Clinic – Landing Page (Practice Project)

A modern, responsive dental clinic landing page built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.

This project is part of my journey to become client-ready in 120 days by building real-world websites through practice and vibe coding while understanding the fundamentals behind the code.

> ⚠️ This project is currently under active development and is used for learning, experimentation, and UI/UX practice.
